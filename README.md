# Just a README file - My new project

## Introduction

> An introduction or lead on what problem you're solving. Answer the question, "Why does someone need this?"

## Code Samples

> You've gotten their attention in the introduction, now show a few code examples. So they get a visualization and as a bonus, make them copy/paste friendly.

## Installation

> The installation instructions are low priority in the readme and should come at the bottom. The first part answers all their objections and now that they want to use it, show them how.

## Interesting, but let's do more research

> Here's a README generator that I used to figure out how to do this: [README generator](https://michaeldyrynda.github.io/readme-generator/)

> I just made a link for that. Click the link.

> No actual code here in this project. Oops. Will learn how to write a good README, and change that here.

## This README is a Work In Progress

> Hey there, GitHub user! Do you already know how to write a great README, and stumbled upon my GitHub page? Feel free to give suggestions!
